# Home-

Dotfiles used for my configuration.

There are some installDirs, do not install everythings, just what you want.
It's not automatic, good luck to install it.

## Install

NB: Install script taken from https://github.com/guillaumewuip/Home

```
./install.sh # To install symlinks
./remove.sh # To remove symlinks
```
